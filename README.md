## Background

*To incorporate the basics of Javascript with some challenging material,* we were instructed to create a password generator that could produce one at random, given user prompts. The prompts included number of characters, uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. If certain requirements weren't met, like choosing a length between 8-120 characters, a series of prompts instruct the user to try again.
